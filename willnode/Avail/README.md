# Avail Setup Script

This script automates the setup process for Avail Light Client.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dante4rt/Ramanode-Guides.git
```
````

2. Navigate to the Avail setup directory:

```bash
cd Ramanode-Guides/Avail
```

3. Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

4. Follow the instructions prompted by the script. You'll be asked if you want to check logs after the setup is complete.
